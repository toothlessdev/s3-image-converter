# Web Image Resizer & Converter

This project aims to simplify the process of uploading optimized images to a static site. It resizes images for different devices (tablet, mobile, PC) and converts them to WebP format before uploading them to S3. The usual manual process is time-consuming, so this tool was created to handle it all at once.
